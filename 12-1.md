## Activity 12.1
### Code
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class InsertionSort {
    public static void insertionSort(int[] numbers) {
        int i;
        int comparisons = 0;
        int swaps = 0;

        for (i = 1; i < numbers.length; ++i) {
            int j = i;
            //insert numbers[i] into sorted part
            //stop once numbers[i] in correct position
            while (j > 0 && numbers[j] < numbers[j - 1]) {

                // Swap numbers[j] and numbers[j - 1]
                int temp = numbers[j];
                numbers[j] = numbers[j - 1];
                numbers[j - 1] = temp;
                --j;

                swaps++;
                comparisons++;
            }
            comparisons++;
        }
        System.out.println("\ncomparisons: " + comparisons);
        System.out.println("swaps: " + swaps);
    }

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter Array (no duplicates): ");
        int size = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] numbers = new int[size];

        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            numbers[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }

        System.out.print("UNSORTED: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; ++i) {
            System.out.print(numbers[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();

        insertionSort(numbers);

        System.out.print("SORTED: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; ++i) {
            System.out.print(numbers[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
### Challenges
Some challenges that I faced while doing this assignment was figuring out how to display the amount of comparisons and swaps, as well as how to include use input into the array. I also took a lot of time to look up how to print each comparison, but I wasn't able to successfully include it in my code. The finished code prints the unsorted array, comparisons, swaps, and the sorted array.
