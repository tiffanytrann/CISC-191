### Challenges
For this code I mostly copied the example merge code from the lecture. My main challenge was making it user input. At first when I first changed my for loop to include the user inputted integers, the sorted and unsorted outputs would all be 0. I soon realized that the issue was in my for loop and I corrected the error. Other than that, I didn't have too many issues and including the number of comparisons in the printed output was easy since I had already learned how to do it from activity 12.1.
