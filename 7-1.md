## Activity 7.1
### Code
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Pedometer {
    public static double stepsToMiles(int steps) throws Exception {
        if (steps < 0) {
            throw new Exception("Exception: Negative step count entered.");
        }
        return steps / 2000.0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the number of steps: ");
        int steps = scanner.nextInt();

        try {
            double miles = stepsToMiles(steps);
            System.out.printf("Miles walked: %.2f", miles);
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
### Challenges
A challenge I faced was how to try and catch. I had to read a few things on what I should do and I looked at the Exceptions lesson examples to kind of copy and see what I needed to do.
