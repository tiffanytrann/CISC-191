### Challenges
A challenge that I had was when I was trying to override, there was an error when I tried to do the bookTitle in my Encyclopedia.java class. I tried changing the public void printInfo() line in my Book.java class to public String printInfo(), and changing the System.out.print to return and changing the strings from private to protected, but it still didn't work. I was going back and forth trying to fix the error, but nothing was working. I decided to take a break and come back with fresh eyes, and I tried to fix the error. For some reason when I changed it back to what it originally was, the error disappeared. I don't know what I did or if I had slightly changed something, but the error was fixed. Other than that, I had no other issues and the process of coding this was very smooth.
